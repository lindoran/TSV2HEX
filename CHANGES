B1.01 == Fixed 2 issues: 1 ) the file loader was forcing all file names to caps this was causeing issues with case sensitive file systems like linux.
2) the program was running the commands table even if there were no arguments before issueing several errors and dropping to the macro prompt 
for more user input.
